Please have in mind that configuration for containers is controlled via environment variables that should be set either (1) as build arguments when building the image or (2) passed as configuration parameters at runtime. In the README files of the projects in this repository we give examples of both cases, such as VC_API_TOKEN as a `--build-arg` for docker build and VC_DRV_MANUAL_HOST_URI as a `--env` for `docker run`. If you need to setup any other configuration, such as credentials for AWS, you can follow any of these routes.
